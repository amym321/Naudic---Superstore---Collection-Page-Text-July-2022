      <p class="content-block-1-title">Our story started in 2008 in Australia.</p>
      <p class="content-block-1-description">Naudic's creator Emma Puttick began her love affair with fashion well before then. She was working in London (as a scientist, no less!), the bohemian styles of the Portobello Road markets were where she first got the taste of what has become the Naudic look. Add influences from travels through Sweden, India and South-East Asia and you have a label that's bright, fun and eminently wearable.</p>
